* In this project, I will be implementing a webpage from a designer file. The focus of this project will be on the HTML structure only, without any CSS or styling. Here are the steps to follow:

# Set up the HTML Document
* Start by creating a new HTML document using the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the beginning. This declaration tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document. Then, enclose the entthee content of the webpage between the opening and closing <html> tags[3].
## Plan the Website Structure
* Before diving into the HTML coding, it's important to plan the structure of the website. Think about the different sections and elements that need to be included, such as the header, navigation menu, main content column, etc. This will help I organize the HTML code and create a well-structured webpage[2].
## Mark up the Text
* Use HTML elements to mark up the text content of the webpage. HTML provides a variety of elements for different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. Refer to the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) HTML documentation for a comprehensive list of HTML elements and thethe usage[5].
## Add Images
* If the designer file includes images, I can add them to the webpage using the <img> element. Make sure to provide the correct file path in the src attribute of the <img> element. Additionally, it's good practice to add alternative text using the alt attribute to improve accessibility for users who rely on screen readers[3].
## Use Inline-level and Block-level Elements
* When arranging elements in an HTML document, it's important to understand the difference between inline-level and block-level elements. Inline-level elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary, while block-level elements start on a new line and take up the entthee width available. Understanding these differences will help I position elements correctly on the webpage[6].
## Add HTML Attributes
* HTML attributes can be used to change the appearance and behavior of HTML elements. For example, I can use the style attribute to add inline styles to an element, or the class attribute to apply CSS classes. Refer to the MDN HTML documentation for a comprehensive list of HTML attributes and thethe usage[9].
## Create Forms
* If the webpage includes forms, I can use HTML form elements such as <form>, <input>, <label>, <textarea>, and <button> to create interactive forms. These elements allow users to input data and submit it to a server for processing. Refer to the MDN HTML documentation for more information on creating forms[10].
